/**
 * The single, centralized Buy Now implementation for the entire app.
 *
 * Every Buy Now entry point (product cards, quick view, wishlist, recently
 * viewed, product details) MUST use this hook — there is intentionally no
 * other Buy Now handler in the codebase.
 *
 * Semantics (idempotent, quantity-exact):
 *  - Purchases EXACTLY the requested `qty` (default 1).
 *  - SETS the cart line to that qty when the product is already in the cart,
 *    otherwise ADDS it. It never accumulates a stale persisted quantity, so
 *    repeated clicks, Back navigation, and refresh can never inflate the count.
 *  - A short per-instance ref lock (700ms) swallows rapid double-taps so a
 *    single burst of taps cannot fire duplicate writes/checkout navigations.
 *  - Routes to /cart after the write settles (unless `navigate: false`, which
 *    lets a wrapping <Link> own the navigation instead).
 *
 * This is purely presentation/flow logic: Add to Cart still accumulates, and
 * analytics, inventory validation, coupons, taxes, shipping, and checkout are
 * untouched — they run on the /cart and checkout screens exactly as before.
